# Heart_Failure_Prediction

Project on Heart Failure using Data Cleaning techniques, principal component analysis, and linear regression to determine the variance of the data.

Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method used for predictive analysis.

It shows a relationship between dependent (Y) and independent variables (X). It finds the value of "Y" changes according to the independent variables.

Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction
PCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. The reduction of the dimensions of the data, yet preserve the variance for analysis. This is important in providing non-parametric analysis.

Variance
In this model we can use Linear Regression and PCA to recognize variance. The more variability in a particular direction correlates with explaining the behavior of the dependent variable.
